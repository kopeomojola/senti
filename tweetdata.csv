"‚ÄúIn the off-season, you tend to put on weight and muscle, and then you cut through the performance season,‚Äù Daley explains. ‚ÄúSo your body is constantly changing all the time, and what‚Äôs really difficult is that you know what your body can look like when you‚Äôre at the Olympics‚Ä¶"
"‚ÄúI was told before the 2012 Olympics I was fat and I had to lose weight,‚Äù Daley explains. ‚ÄúAnd especially when you‚Äôre in diving, everything‚Äôs on show."
"Daley burst onto the international scene at age 14 when he competed in the 2008 Olympics in Beijing. A lesson Daley did not realize he had learned until more recently is how the innocence of his youth benefited him in those early international competitions."
"‚ÄúI think there‚Äôs something really powerful about going to the Olympic games and being there as part of the LGBT community and not only just being there but also doing well so that it actually creates some kind of visibility in all parts of the world."
"As Daley sees it, the fact they are talking about him is proof he‚Äôs already changing the narrative in those countries, forcing thought leaders in the media and elsewhere to admit that LGBTQ+ athletes exist and that one of them just won an Olympic gold medal."
"But I do think there‚Ä¶should be a certain standard that the [International Olympic Committee] holds the countries to in terms of just basic protections for queer athletes and for the people that are in [those countries].‚Äù"
"He advocated banning those countries from future Olympics, although he admits it would be a difficult policy to implement."
"At the Attitude Awards last year, he called out countries that criminalize same-sex sexual relations, often with death sentences, and yet were still allowed to compete in the Olympics."
"Winning that medal was a stressful process, and one of the ways Daley dealt with the anxiety of competition was with his newfound passion for knitting and crocheting, an avocation that made viral headlines in the days following his Olympic win."
"He came away with Olympic bronze medals in 2012 and 2016, but Olympic gold remained elusive until last year. Daley famously wiped away tears as he and Lee collected their medals."
"‚ÄúInitially, going to the Olympics was my dream, and representing Team [Great Britain]. Once I started to believe that I could one day win an Olympic gold medal, that was my aim,‚Äù Daley says of his decades-long quest to be the best at his sport."
